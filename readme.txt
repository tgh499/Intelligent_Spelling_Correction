Summary: Correcting spelling mistakes like "campagn" (campaign) is comparatively easy.

However, if you intend to type 'three', a common mistake is typing 'there' instead of 'three'. Both 'there' and 'three' are spelled correctly. However, if we compare the phrases 'three days' and 'there days', it it obvious 'three days' is the correct phrase.
